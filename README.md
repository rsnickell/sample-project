# Sample Project demonstrating a REST API and a cli client.

There are two projects in this repository:
- [server](./server/README.md)
- [client](./client/README.md)

# Server
The server provides a REST API to create/read/update loans. The [README.md](./server/README.md) provides details on setup and running the service locally.

# Client
The client is a cli based client that enables a user to call the REST API using command line arguments. The [README.md](./client/README.md) provides details on how to run the cli, what options are supported, and examples.
